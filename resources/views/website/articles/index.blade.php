						<h3>Background and what are you working on.</h3>
						<p>My name is Andrew Carpenter, and my background is in industrial/organizational psychology, which I studied at Colorado State, as well as business analytics, which I studied at CU-Boulder. My mission is to combine these two fields, the study of business data and the study of business people, to produce business processes that make people successful. </p>
						<p>Intrinio, where I am the director of HR analytics, is giving me a chance to do just that. I joined Intrinio as employee number four in 2015. Since then, I have helped create the sales, support, HR, and marketing infrastructure the company needs to scale. Intrinio provides financial data and apps that analyze that data in a fintech marketplace. Our users are evenly split between developers that use our API (application programming interface) to build apps for investors, and investors who use those apps to make investment decisions. With the help of the internal systems we have developed, we've managed to scale to over 10,000 users, and we're currently onboarding 50-60 users per day. My hope is that, through this interview, I can shed some light on the business processes and tools that let us handle such high volumes affordably with a very small team. They've helped us grow from a startup doing $10,000 a month in revenue in 2016 to a scaling business whose users make 5 million API calls a day.</p>
						<h3>Story behind how Intrinio got started.</h3>
						<p>Joey French and Rachel Carpenter (my sister) founded Intrinio in 2012. They both had backgrounds in finance and thought there should be a way to automate financial analyses. They set off to build an app that would value a stock with the push of a button. However, when they went to financial data providers looking for data to power the app, the quotes came back at $50,000 a month. At the time they had no funding, so shelling out $600,000 a year just for data was impossible.</p>
						<h2>“Our team has experienced all of the problems our platform solves.”</h2>
						<h3>What convinced you to join</h3>
						<p>Joey and Rachel were pissed off at data providers, and their anger rubbed off on me. There aren't a lot of apps out there that enable everyday people to make good investment decisions, because startup app developers can't get the data they need to build innovative tools. The result is that poor people can't learn to invest for themselves, because only a "professional" can afford the training and tools needed to understand the market. Since we already had the data, we ended up building the original automated investing app idea, but by 2015 the data was the focus, so we made the app free. Today, we keep the finan</p>
